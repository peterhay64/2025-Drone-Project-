Hi! This is my code for my DIY quadcopter project. Ive added my code for my Visual Studio GUI, and it is in that file where you will also find the controller input controls for the drone. 
I have two seperate files for the Arduino Code that are very similar, however one turns on the motors with the push of the 'A' button on the XBox controller, while the other reads the left joystick 
to slowly increase the speed of the motors.
